* **Query-synthesizing** approaches: which use generative models to generate informative samples.#
* **Query-acquiring** approaches: use different sampling strategies to select the most informative samples.
  - Uncertainty-based approaches: examples which are the most uncertain (output probabilities near 0.5) by the model will be annotated by an oracle.
  - Representation-based approaches: which rely on selecting few examples by increasing diversity in a given batch.
  - Their combinations.
